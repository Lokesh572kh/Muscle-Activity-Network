# Muscle-Activity-Network
Humans play more than 8000 sports, of which 200 are internationally recognised. Yet, a very common notion is that athletic people are good at all of them. After all, all actions are simply a sequence of activations of muscles from the same body. But in reality, how similar are two different sports, like swimming and cricket, and which are the few key muscles that make a true athlete? By understanding how different sports utilise similar muscle groups, individuals can improve performance, enhance enjoyment, and minimise injury risks. This knowledge can help them strengthen key muscles, optimise cross-training benefits, and choose sports that complement their natural proficiencies.
